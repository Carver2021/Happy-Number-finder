# Happy-Number-finder
I am writing code to find "happy numbers"


To find happy numbers you square each of the digits and add them up, and repeat until you hit a recurring loop or the number 1.

If you find the number 1 after iterations.. it is a happy number, however, there are some numbers that cause a repeating series of numbes to repeat.. these are not happy numbers

For a reference to this... look up Recreational mathematics.. from Doctor Who... 

I welcome constructive criticism... this is my first actual code after watiching some videos on how to code in dart... so be nice... I am a noob beginner...
